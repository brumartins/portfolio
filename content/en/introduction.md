### Introduction

Hi, my name is Bruno Martins and I have been a **Full Stack developer** for 7 years.

I am currently looking for a **full remote** position in France, in a product-oriented environment with a strong emphasis on craftsmanship culture.

In my free time, I love to read and play chess (currently member of Lavaur Chess club).
